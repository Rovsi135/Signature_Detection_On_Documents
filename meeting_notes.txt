Meeting Questions:
    Tested the first model on my personal documents and seen horrible results.
    therefore, I have decided to find a new dataset with new format (jpg) and RGB. 
    Fine-Tuned pre-existing model on the mixed dataset.
    Is there other ways to improve this model than updating the dataset and retraining/fine-tuning it.


image data augmentation
alternative models (test with same conditions for a better results.)
prepare data for a next yolo model.
github share repo
linkedIn CemnurUzun.
Maybe test a bigger model?


    
Restrictions:
    - The train dataset contains uint8 .tif images for model #1. 
    - The train dataset contains uint8 .tif, and jpg images for model #2.

Progress:
    -Trained Model sig_yolo11s_img896_2:
        added the new dataset from roboflow: "signatures-xc8up"
            SOME OF THE LABELINGS ARE NOT TIGHT, MIGHT AFFECT THE Model

        Results for validation(true metrics shall be obtained by test set):

        box_loss = ~0.63
        cls_loss = ~0.39
        dfl_loss = ~0.935
    
    - Converting data into yolo readable format:
        Split the data into train, val, test
        Normalize the bounds of the box (Have been checked with visualizer.)

    - Lable_Visualizer
        Can visualize labeled box, given csv for label and image in .tif format. (For both normalized and not normalized form)
        
    - Data_Loader: 
        Can convert the labels into Pandas DataFrame for easier lookup.
        Can check for missing rows.

TODO:
    - Domain shift problem: Generalization to RGB .png files with different dimensions do NOT work well.
        I have tried to convert the png to tiff, however the issue is not resolved.


    - Test on different dataset (Tested on personal small dataset)
    - Introduce confidence treshold (this is done when predicting.)
    - Train model again:
        - use bigger size/higher parameters for better metrics?
    - make a script that runs the model on a given .tif
    - evaluate
    - check bad evaluated data
    - Croppable boxes if the evaluation is good enough
